# RHEL-Scenario

This repository serves as an educational resource for individuals looking to improve or validate their skills in RHEL 9 in preparation for the RHSCA EX200 exam. Most of the scenarios here should be compatible with RHEL 8+.

**Prerequisite**: It is assumed that you have already taken a course on RHEL or have some prior experience with the operating system.

## Installation Instructions for Red Hat

### Requirements:
- **RHEL 8+ ISO**
- VirtualBox (or a similar virtualization tool)

### Steps:

1. **Install VirtualBox**:  
   If you donâ€™t already have VirtualBox, download and install it from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

   Follow a tutorial for configuring VirtualBox for your system.

2. **Download RHEL ISO**:  
   Download the RHEL version you need from Red Hat's website: [Red Hat Downloads](https://www.redhat.com). You can opt for the trial version, which is valid for a set period. (Proton support may be available if you need it.)

   Alternatively, you can download CentOS Stream 9+, as most commands in these tasks will work similarly.

3. **Setup VirtualBox**:  
   After downloading the RHEL ISO, add it to VirtualBox and start the virtual machine to begin installation.
