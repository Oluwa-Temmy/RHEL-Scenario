# RHEL-Scenario

This repository serves as an educational resource for individuals looking to improve or validate their skills in RHEL 9 in preparation for the RHSCA EX200 exam. Most of the scenarios here should be compatible with RHEL 8+.

**Prerequisite**: It is assumed that you have already taken a course on RHEL or have some prior experience with the operating system.

## :memo: Installation Instructions for Red Hat

### Requirements:
- **RHEL 8+ ISO**
- VirtualBox (or a similar virtualization tool)

### Steps:

1. **Install VirtualBox**: 
   If you donâ€™t already have VirtualBox, download and install it from [VirtualBox Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

   Follow a tutorial for configuring VirtualBox for your system.

2. **Download RHEL ISO**:  
   Download the RHEL version you need from Red Hat's website: [Red Hat Downloads](https://www.redhat.com). You can opt for the trial version, which is valid for a set period. (Proton support may be available if you need it.)

   Alternatively, you can download CentOS Stream 9+, as most commands in these tasks will work similarly.

3. **Setup VirtualBox**:  
   After downloading the RHEL ISO, add it to VirtualBox 
   
   For some solutions you may need 
   2 machines.

   Each of your machines should have at least 5GB V and 4G of Ram

## :thinking: How to Use This Resource

You can begin using this resource from any section you like. Each part is designed to address a specific objective from the Red Hat RHCSA EX200 exam.

The key points for each objective are divided into separate parts. These parts are independent of one another, so you can work through them in any order unless a prerequisite or continuation is specified.

Each task includes a corresponding solution. In this format:
- `task.md`
- `task-Solution.md`

- `task1.md`
- `task1-Solution.md`
